## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, jQuery

I am proud to say that my current work is my best yet! I utilized jQuery and Bootstrap to create visually appealing designs and animations to ensure my website makes a great first impression. For simplicity, I chose a single-page layout.

Upon entering the site, the user will see a loading screen before arriving at the landing section. In the intro section, the h1 header morphs between three different options, and clicking the menu and CTA buttons trigger a smooth scroll effect for navigation. Scrolling further down, the site features various quotes purely for aesthetic purposes. In the services section, there are five icons that alter the text to describe their respective services. My portfolio section showcases all of my work with categories for easy sorting. Clicking a category will cause the projects to fade in and out and move towards the beginning if possible.

I recently used MailChimp for the first time to manage newsletter subscriptions and found their free plan user-friendly. For the contact section, I used Netlify's form management system, which I always use for site building because it's easy to use. Additionally, I included a Calendly scheduling app below the contact form for users who want to book a meeting immediately.

## Optimizations

To enhance the website's speed, it would be beneficial to convert some of the jQuery animations to pure JS. This will reduce the amount of unused JS, which can slow down the site. Additionally, replacing BootStrap with the more lightweight CSS framework, Tailwind CSS could also improve the website's performance.

## Lessons Learned:

I'm proud to have created this website and share it with the world! While I've learned many new techniques and animations, there is still much to discover. I am excited to continue improving my front-end skills to create even more impressive, efficient, and optimized websites.
